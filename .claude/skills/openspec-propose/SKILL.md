Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)
- github-issue.json (the planning GitHub issue reference)

When ready to implement, ask me to implement the change.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Ask the user an open-ended question:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change in the planning home resolved by the CLI with `.openspec.yaml`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context. Use these instead of assuming repo-local paths.


4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `resolvedOutputPath`: Resolved path or pattern to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure and write it to `resolvedOutputPath`
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Ask the user to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Create the planning GitHub issue and metadata**

   After every `applyRequires` artifact is complete, create the GitHub issue before any implementation begins. Build a Markdown body from the completed planning artifacts with this structure:
   ```markdown
   ## Plan: <change-name>
   ### Context and motivation
   ### Proposed behavior and capabilities
   ### Design decisions and trade-offs
   ### Implementation plan
   ### Planned verification
   ### Planning artifacts
   ```
   The body describes only the proposed change: use the proposal for motivation and intended behavior, specifications for capabilities and scenarios, design for decisions and trade-offs, tasks for the implementation plan, and the change path plus artifact names for **Planning artifacts**. Do not claim delivered behavior, completed tasks, or verification results. When an artifact contains no source-backed content for a section, write `_Not specified in the plan._` rather than inventing detail.

   Write the rendered body to a temporary file outside the worktree, then create the issue:
   ```bash
   issue_url="$(gh issue create --title "Plan: <name>" --body-file "$issue_body")"
   gh issue view "$issue_url" --json url,number
   ```
   Write `<changeRoot>/github-issue.json` with the canonical issue URL:
   ```json
   {
     "issue": "<canonical issue URL>"
   }
   ```
   Remove the temporary body file after creation. If a valid `github-issue.json` already exists for a resumed change, parse it and verify that its issue resolves with `gh issue view <issue-reference> --json url,state` and has state `OPEN`; only then keep it. Otherwise stop and report the conflict rather than creating or attaching a duplicate issue.

6. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- The created planning issue URL and the `github-issue.json` location
- Prompt: "All artifacts created! Ask me to implement the change to start working on the tasks."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
- Every proposed change MUST create or retain exactly one valid `github-issue.json` containing the canonical URL of its planning issue.
